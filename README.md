# Git Worktree CLI (gwt)

[![CI](https://github.com/mikko-kohtala/git-worktree-cli/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mikko-kohtala/git-worktree-cli/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

üåø **Enhanced Git Worktree Management with Rust** üåø

Stop juggling multiple git clones or constantly switching branches. `git worktree` lets you check out multiple branches in the same repository at once. This tool makes managing them effortless.

## What are Git Worktrees?

Instead of cloning a repository multiple times or constantly running `git checkout`, worktrees let you have multiple working directories, each tied to a different branch, all within a single repo.

**Before:**
```bash
# Multiple clones or constant branch switching
git clone repo.git feature-work
git clone repo.git bugfix-work
# OR: git checkout feature && git checkout main ...
```

**After:**
```bash
# One repository, multiple working directories
my-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature-123/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bugfix-456/
```

## Installation

### Build from Source

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mikko-kohtala/git-worktree-cli.git ~/.gwt
    cd ~/.gwt
    ```

2.  **Build the binary:**
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

3.  **Add to your PATH:**
    ```bash
    # For macOS/Linux
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.gwt/target/release:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc # or ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.zshrc # or ~/.bashrc
    ```

4.  **Install Shell Completions (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    # Auto-install for your detected shell
    gwt completions install
    ```
    This command supports `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, `powershell`, and `elvish`.

### Other Methods (Coming Soon)

-   **Direct Binary Download**: Pre-built binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows.
-   **Cargo**: `cargo install gwt`

## Quick Start

1.  **Initialize a Project:**
    ```bash
    # Clone a repo and set it up for worktree management
    gwt init git@github.com:username/repo.git
    ```
    This clones the repository into a directory named after its default branch (e.g., `main/`) and creates a `git-worktree-config.jsonc` file.

2.  **Add a Worktree:**
    ```bash
    # Create a new worktree for a feature branch
    gwt add feature/user-auth
    ```

3.  **List Worktrees:**
    ```bash
    # See all your worktrees and their pull request status
    gwt list
    ```

4.  **Remove a Worktree:**
    ```bash
    # Clean up a completed feature
    gwt remove feature/user-auth
    ```
